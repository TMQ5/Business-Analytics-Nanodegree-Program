# Analyze NYSE Data
## Project Description
In this project we will analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. You will be drawing a subset of a large dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse) that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. You will go through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing an inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. The goal is for you to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.

## Project Tasks
### Task 1:
a. Identify the question about the data that you will answer based on your data analysis, and include this in your **slide presentation**.

* Your question should include **at least one categorical variable** (GICS Sector or GICS Sub Industry) **and one quantitative variable** (one of the financial metrics) and require the use of **at least one of the summary statistics**.
* A **tab within the Excel spreadsheet** that you submit should include the summary statistics [measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median) and measures of spread (standard deviation and range)] you used to answer your question.
* Deliverable: Slide presentation, Spreadsheet with tab for Summary statistics

b. Your slide presentation should provide **at least one visualization** to help with your answer.

* This visualization might be a bar chart, histogram, scatterplot, box-plot or other visual that you learned to make. Include your insights from the measures of center and spread and at least one numeric summary statistic in the description.
* Deliverable: Slide presentation (includes visualization)

### Task 2:
* Create a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list.
* Your drop-down list should pull historical fundamentals data to create the P&L Statement.
* The P&L statement should include the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT values for all the years there is historical data available for that company in the dataset.
* Deliverable: Spreadsheet with tab for Dynamic P&L statement

### Task 3:
* Create a financial model for a company (different from Task 2) of your choice that forecasts out the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for two more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case and Base case).
* Your assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin and operating margin should change for each scenario.
* The forecasting model should be dynamic for the selection of the case (Weak, Base, Strong). However, the forecasting model can be static for the chosen company sticker symbol.
* Deliverable: Spreadsheet with tab for Forecasting Model

## Project Submission
1. A presentation file that should include a slide with:

* A statement of the question you posed
* Summary statistics and plots communicating your final results

Formatting of your submission:
* Feel free to use our template to develop the presentation.
* In order to submit your presentation for review, **you will need to save your slides as a PDF or PowerPoint PPT file**. You can create a PDF file from within Google Slides by selecting **File > Download as > PDF Document**.

2. Excel Workbook or Google Sheets with tabs for each of the following:

* Dataset
* Summary statistics
* Profit and Loss statement dashboard
* Forecast model for three scenarios
* Your workbook can include additional tabs you may need for your project (e.g.,  pivot tables).

Formatting of your submission:
* The **Forecast model should be set to the company of your choice**. You may choose to have the ticker symbol or name of the company in text at the top for the forecast model.
* **You will also need to save your spreadsheet in .xlsx format OR provide a link to your Google Sheets** . You should **provide the link to the Google sheet in your presentation slides** since Google Sheets formulas do not download properly into Excel and the reviewer will not be able to see all the formulas.

3. A list of websites, books, forums, blog posts, etc. that you referred to or used in creating your submission (add N/A if you did not use any such resources).

4. **Zip (compress) the folder** and submit this zipped folder with both files in it.

# Build Data Dashboards 
## Project Description
In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

**There are 3 different data sets you can choose from**.

* [Flight Delays and Cancellations](https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays/data)
* [US Census Demographic Data](https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data/data)
* [Youtube Data from the US](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new/data)

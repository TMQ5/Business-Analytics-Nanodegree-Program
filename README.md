# Business-Analytics-Nanodegree-Program
## Overview:
This is a nanodegree program provided by Udacity learning platform and sponsored by Misk Academy in Future Seekers Challenge. [Click on this link to check out my certification](https://confirm.udacity.com/QVEXPQG3).

This course help to learn foundational data skills that apply across functions and industries. Learn to analyze data and build models with Excel, and create informative data visualizations with Tableau. Gain foundational data skills applicable to any industry. Collect and analyze data, model business scenarios, and communicate the findings with  Excel, and Tableau.



## [Project1 (Interpret a Data Visualization)](https://github.com/TMQ5/Business-Analytics-Nanodegree-Program/blob/main/Dashboard%20for%20LinkedIn%20Top%20Skills%20Report.pdf)
### Project description

This project is aimed at analysis using data visualization in Tableau. we’ve selected a few Tableau dashboards for you to explore. 

Choose one of these dashboards, whichever one interests you the most:

[Madrid in Detail](https://public.tableau.com/views/MadridInDetail/MadridinDetail?%3Aembed=y&%3Atoolbar=yes&%3AloadOrderID=0&%3Adisplay_count=y%3F%3Aembed&%3AshowVizHome=no)

[Malaria in Africa](https://public.tableau.com/views/MakeoverMonday34Malaria_0/MalariainAfrica?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no&:display_count=y&:display_static_image=y&:bootstrapWhenNotified=true)

[LinkedIn Top Skills](https://public.tableau.com/profile/matt.chambers#!/vizhome/LinkedInTopSkills2016-MakeoverMonday/LinkedInTopSkills2016-MakeoverMonday)

Then find three insights in the visualizations. For each insight, provide a static image that shares what you found. Write a short report explaining each observation and how you found the information to reach your conclusion from the dashboard. Altogether (including images), your report should be 1-2 pages.





## [Project2 (Analyze NYSE Data)](https://github.com/TMQ5/Business-Analytics-Nanodegree-Program/blob/main/NYSE%20Project%20Presentation.pdf)
### Project description
In this project we will analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. You will be drawing a subset of a large dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse) that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. You will go through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing an inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. The goal is for you to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.

### Task 1:
 Identify the question about the data that you will answer based on your data analysis, and include this in your slide presentation.
 
 ### Task 2:
 Create a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list.
Your drop-down list should pull historical fundamentals data to create the P&L Statement.
The P&L statement should include the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT values for all the years there is historical data available for that company in the dataset.
Deliverable: Spreadsheet with tab for Dynamic P&L statement

### Task 3:
Create a financial model for a company (different from Task 2) of your choice that forecasts out the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for two more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case and Base case).
Your assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin and operating margin should change for each scenario.
The forecasting model should be dynamic for the selection of the case (Weak, Base, Strong). However, the forecasting model can be static for the chosen company sticker symbol.
Deliverable: Spreadsheet with tab for Forecasting Model





## [Project3 (Predicting Diamond Prices)](https://github.com/TMQ5/Business-Analytics-Nanodegree-Program/blob/main/Diamonds%20Project.pdf)
### Project description
A diamond distributor has recently decided to exit the market and has put up a set of 3,000 diamonds up for auction. Seeing this as a great opportunity to expand its inventory, a jewelry company has shown interest in making a bid. To decide how much to bid, the company’s analytics team used a large database of diamond prices to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a diamond based on its attributes. You, as the business analysts, are tasked to apply that model to make a recommendation for how much the company should bid for the entire set of 3,000 diamonds.





## [Project4 (Build Data Dashboards)](https://github.com/TMQ5/Business-Analytics-Nanodegree-Program/blob/main/Build%20Data%20Dashboards.pdf)
### Project description
In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

There are 3 different data sets you can choose from.

Flight Delays and Cancellations
US Census Demographic Data
Youtube Data from the US

Make sure you include the following files and information:

A PDF or Markdown report that includes the following sections:
Links to your dashboards or story
You must submit url links for each of your visuals from Tableau Public. If you need a reminder on how to save to Tableau Public, please see the next concept.
Summary: brief description of the visualization and the main story or findings conveyed
Design: explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback
Resources: list of Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, GitHub repositories etc that you referred to or used in this submission (Add N/A if you did not use such resources).

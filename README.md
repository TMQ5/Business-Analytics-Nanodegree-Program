# Project1 (Interpret a Data Visualization)
## Project description

This project is aimed at analysis using data visualization in Tableau. A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explain your insights to others. To give you some practice with this, weâ€™ve selected a few Tableau dashboards for you to explore. The links are below, under "Choose from these Dashboards." Choose one of these dashboards, whichever one interests you the most, and find three insights in the visualizations. For each insight, provide a static image that shares what you found. Write a short report explaining each observation and how you found the information to reach your conclusion from the dashboard. Altogether (including images), your report should be 1-2 pages.

Choose from these dashboards:

# Project2 (

In this project we will analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. You will be drawing a subset of a large dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse) that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. We have created a smaller subset of the data that you will be using for the project.

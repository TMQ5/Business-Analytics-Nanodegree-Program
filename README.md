## [Project1 (Interpret a Data Visualization)](https://github.com/TMQ5/Business-Analytics-Nanodegree-Program/blob/main/Dashboard%20for%20LinkedIn%20Top%20Skills%20Report.pdf)
### Project description

This project is aimed at analysis using data visualization in Tableau. weâ€™ve selected a few Tableau dashboards for you to explore. 

Choose one of these dashboards, whichever one interests you the most:

[Madrid in Detail](https://public.tableau.com/views/MadridInDetail/MadridinDetail?%3Aembed=y&%3Atoolbar=yes&%3AloadOrderID=0&%3Adisplay_count=y%3F%3Aembed&%3AshowVizHome=no)

[Malaria in Africa](https://public.tableau.com/views/MakeoverMonday34Malaria_0/MalariainAfrica?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no&:display_count=y&:display_static_image=y&:bootstrapWhenNotified=true)

[LinkedIn Top Skills](https://public.tableau.com/profile/matt.chambers#!/vizhome/LinkedInTopSkills2016-MakeoverMonday/LinkedInTopSkills2016-MakeoverMonday)

Then find three insights in the visualizations. For each insight, provide a static image that shares what you found. Write a short report explaining each observation and how you found the information to reach your conclusion from the dashboard. Altogether (including images), your report should be 1-2 pages.





## [Project2 (Analyze NYSE Data)](https://github.com/TMQ5/Business-Analytics-Nanodegree-Program/blob/main/NYSE%20Project%20Presentation.pdf)
### Project description
In this project we will analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. You will be drawing a subset of a large dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse) that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. You will go through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing an inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. The goal is for you to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.

### Task 1:
 Identify the question about the data that you will answer based on your data analysis, and include this in your slide presentation.
 
 ### Task 2:
 Create a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list.
Your drop-down list should pull historical fundamentals data to create the P&L Statement.
The P&L statement should include the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT values for all the years there is historical data available for that company in the dataset.
Deliverable: Spreadsheet with tab for Dynamic P&L statement

### Task 3:
Create a financial model for a company (different from Task 2) of your choice that forecasts out the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for two more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case and Base case).
Your assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin and operating margin should change for each scenario.
The forecasting model should be dynamic for the selection of the case (Weak, Base, Strong). However, the forecasting model can be static for the chosen company sticker symbol.
